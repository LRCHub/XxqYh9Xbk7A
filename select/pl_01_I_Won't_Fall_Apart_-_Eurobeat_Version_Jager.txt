You really made a mess of me -
no baby don't deny it
A ghost of my nights so sweet -
I will forget about it
Your love like a nail in deep -
but now it's healin' away
You let me here to blood
I'll mend alone this bitter
feelin'
I'll fight the fears
And dry my tears
Won't try any more oh never no
more
The words so pure
They're punchin' bold
And startin' to blow
Get out of my head
Get out of my heart
Away baby, I
Won't fall apart
Get out of my head
Get out of my heart
I'm telling you I
Won't fall apart
I'll smile again
Run again
No one else
nobody nobody
Cheatin' me
Foolin' me
Like you did
nobody nobody no
You think I'll be there on my
knees -
no baby don't deny it
In pieces cryin' out my pain -
I will forget about it
I'll breathe alone I feel so
free -
but now it's healin' away
I'll let you dream your dream
Away from me, hands off my
feelings
I'll fight the fears
And dry my tears
Won't try any more oh never no
more
The words so pure
They're punchin' bold
And startin' to blow
Get out of my head
Get out of my heart
Away baby, I
Won't fall apart
Get out of my head
Get out of my heart
I'm telling you I
Won't fall apart
I'll smile again
Run again
No one else
nobody nobody
Cheatin' me
Foolin' me
Like you did
nobody nobody no
Get out of my head
Get out of my heart
Away baby, I
Won't fall apart
Get out of my head
Get out of my heart
I'm telling you I
Won't fall apart
Get out of my head
Get out of my heart
Away baby, I
Won't fall apart
Get out of my head
Get out of my heart
I'm telling you I
Won't fall apart
I'll smile again
Run again
No one else
nobody nobody
Cheatin' me
Foolin' me
Like you did
nobody nobody no
