[00:01.72] Get out of my head
[00:04.46] Get out of my heart
[00:06.37] Away baby, I
[00:07.25] Won't fall apart
[00:09.07] Get out of my head
[00:09.90] Get out of my heart
[00:11.77] I'm telling you I
[00:13.63] Won't fall apart
[00:45.20] You really made a mess of me - no baby don't deny it
[00:47.97] A ghost of my nights so sweet - I will forget about it
[00:51.65] Your love like a nail in deep - but now it's healin' away
[00:54.32] You let me here to blood
[00:56.10] I'll mend alone this bitter feelin'
[00:57.95] I'll fight the fears
[00:59.71] And dry my tears
[01:01.67] Won't try any more oh never no more
[01:04.31] The words so pure
[01:06.16] They're punchin' bold
[01:07.98] And startin' to blow
[01:09.79] Get out of my head
[01:10.67] Get out of my heart
[01:12.50] Away baby, I
[01:14.33] Won't fall apart
[01:16.11] Get out of my head
[01:17.01] Get out of my heart
[01:18.98] I'm telling you I
[01:20.70] Won't fall apart
[01:23.45] I'll smile again
[01:25.35] Run again
[01:26.25] No one else nobody nobody
[01:29.95] Cheatin' me
[01:31.78] Foolin' me
[01:32.62] Like you did nobody nobody no
[01:50.72] You think I'll be there on my knees - no baby don't deny it
[01:53.43] In pieces cryin' out my pain - I will forget about it
[01:57.08] I'll breathe alone I feel so free - but now it's healin' away
[01:59.73] I'll let you dream your dream
[02:01.60] Away from me, hands off my feelings
[02:04.32] I'll fight the fears
[02:05.23] And dry my tears
[02:07.08] Won't try any more oh never no more
[02:10.67] The words so pure
[02:11.55] They're punchin' bold
[02:13.39] And startin' to blow
[02:15.14] Get out of my head
[02:16.17] Get out of my heart
[02:17.97] Away baby, I
[02:19.75] Won't fall apart

[02:22.55] Get out of my heart
[02:24.34] I'm telling you I
[02:26.20] Won't fall apart
[02:28.96] I'll smile again

[02:32.51] No one else nobody nobody
[02:35.28] Cheatin' me
[02:37.05] Foolin' me
[02:38.91] Like you did nobody nobody no
[03:20.53] Get out of my head
[03:22.31] Get out of my heart
[03:24.17] Away baby, I
